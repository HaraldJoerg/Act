=head1 Act evolution stage0 Release Notes

Well, this isn't exactly a release, but it is a status: A fork of Act
which is easy to install, passes all its unit tests and can perform
some real life workflows.

=head2 Overview

This is a fork of L<Act|https://github.com/book/Act>, the conference
toolkit which has helped organizing lots of Perl conferences.  It is a
pretty eclectic one, including stuff from the
L<psgi|https://github.com/book/Act/tree/psgi> branch of the original
repository, stuff from Ilya Chesnokov's
L<psgi_fixes|https://github.com/ichesnokov/Act/tree/psgi_fixes>
branch, and from Wesley Schwengle's
L<act-two|https://github.com/waterkip/Act/tree/act-two> branch.  Up to
this stage, this fork intentionally doesn't contain much work of its
own: It is a collection of valuable stuff found on different
locations.  Additions and changes were made only to the end to get the
installation "up and running".

As you'd guess from the ancestry, this fork is based on PSGI instead
of the original which operates on CGI and mod_perl.  This is also an
intentional change, because 1) the original setup is rather difficult
to reproduce, 2) PSGI web servers allow for convenient development and
debugging, and 3) it doesn't matter at all for many other components
of Act (e.g. the database handling).

The original work at this stage - in addition to bug fixes - is a
rework of the dispatcher module, which now is a bit simpler, as a set
of unit tests, and some documentation.

=head2 Purpose

The releases in this fork shall all have the following properties:

=over

=item Can be installed easily.

For Debian and Ubuntu, there's a procedure to install the set over at
L<act-starter-debian|https://github.com/HaraldJoerg/act-starter-debian>,
others should find instructions at
L<Act::Manual::Developer::DeveloperInstall>.

=item All test cases pass

This should go without saying, but we've seen forks where the tests
won't even compile.

=item New features come with tests and documentation

A software projects driven by volunteers needs an easy welcome to new
developers who are willing to spend a few, but not too much brain
cycles.
